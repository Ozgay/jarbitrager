JArbitrager is a fully automated trading system (ATS) that can trade various types of market securities during the trading day without user monitoring. All aspects of trading, such as obtaining market prices, analyzing price patterns, making trading decisions, placing orders, monitoring order executions, and controlling the risk are automated according to the user preferences. The central idea behind JArbitrager is to completely remove emotions from trading, so that the trading system can systematically and consistently follow a predefined set of rules.

The features include strategy backtesting, optimization, market data recording, and real time trading via the Interactive Brokers API.

JArbitrager is intended for software developers. It is not an "off-the-shelf" product that can be installed and run. Instead, JArbitrager provides a framework for developing automated trading systems and requires a certain amount of programming knowledge and experience in Java. The users can modify any part of the source code, implement their own trading strategies, and customize the system in any way. If you are not a software developer or if you don't have much experience programming in Java, JArbitrager is probably not for you.
